Scenario Based questions:

Question 1:
Will the reducer work or not if you use “Limit 1” in any HiveQL query?

Ans: No, because no aggregation is required to select a single row from
the table


Question 2:
Suppose I have installed Apache Hive on top of my Hadoop cluster using default 
metastore configuration. Then, what will happen if we have multiple clients trying 
to access Hive at the same time? 

Ans: An error will occur because Hive uses a Derby database as its defualt and therefore
it only allows one client to access this database at a time.

Question 3:
Suppose, I create a table that contains details of all the transactions done by the customers: 
CREATE TABLE transaction_details (cust_id INT, amount FLOAT, month STRING, country STRING) 
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ ;
Now, after inserting 50,000 records in this table, I want to know the total revenue generated for each month. 
But, Hive is taking too much time in processing this query. How will you solve this problem and list the steps 
that I will be taking in order to do so?

Ans: Two approches can be followed
1. Re-create the table while using the month column as a partition for the table.
#### CREATING THE TABLE WITH PARTITIONS #####
CREATE TABLE tb_name
(
    cust_id int,
    amount float,
    country string
) 
partitioned by (month string)
row format DELIMITED
fields termintated by ','




Question 4:
How can you add a new partition for the month December in the above partitioned table?
#### CREATING THE TABLE WITH PARTITIONS #####
CREATE TABLE tb_name
(
    cust_id int,
    amount float,
    country string
) 
partitioned by (month = "December")
row format DELIMITED
fields termintated by ','


Question 5:
I am inserting data into a table based on partitions dynamically. But, I received an 
error – FAILED ERROR IN SEMANTIC ANALYSIS: Dynamic partition strict mode requires at 
least one static partition column. How will you remove this error?

Ans: We have to set the dynamic partition mode to 'nonstrict' using the command below
`set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict`


Question 6:
Suppose, I have a CSV file – ‘sample.csv’ present in ‘/temp’ directory with the following entries:
id first_name last_name email gender ip_address
How will you consume this CSV file into the Hive warehouse using built-in SerDe?

Ans: By creating a table with the given schema below
CREATE TABLE tb_name
(
    id int,
    first_name string,
    last_name string,
    email string,
    gender string,
    ip_address string
)
row format DELIMITED
fields terminated by " ";


Question 7:
Suppose, I have a lot of small CSV files present in the input directory in HDFS 
and I want to create a single Hive table corresponding to these files. The data in 
these files are in the format: {id, name, e-mail, country}. Now, as we know, Hadoop 
performance degrades when we use lots of small files.
So, how will you solve this problem where we want to create a single Hive table for 
lots of small files without degrading the performance of the system?


Question 8:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH ‘Home/country/state/’
OVERWRITE INTO TABLE address;

The following statement failed to execute. What can be the cause?

Ans: Incorrect syntax, we can't overwrite the data in a table using the load command.


Question 9:
Is it possible to add 100 nodes when we already have 100 nodes in Hive? If yes, how?

Ans: Yes it is. We do this by configuring the newly added hundred nodes with the
cluster using the namenode and then setting up the hive program in each of the
nodes.


Hive Practical questions:

Question 10: Hive Join operations

Create a  table named CUSTOMERS(ID | NAME | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY)
Create a Second  table ORDER(OID | DATE | CUSTOMER_ID | AMOUNT
)

Now perform different joins operations on top of these tables
(Inner JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN ,RIGHT OUTER JOIN ,FULL OUTER JOIN)

Ans:
create database hive_class_b1;

use hive_class_b1;

create table customers
(
	id int,
	name string,
	age int,
	address string,
	salary int
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ',';


create table order
(
	o_id int,
	date datetime,
	customer_id int,
	amount int
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ',';
